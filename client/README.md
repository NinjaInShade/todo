# Todo application client built with react and bootstrap and (tabler icons)[https://tablericons.com/].

## PLEASE USE DESKTOP. I tried to make it responsive and it simply has failed. The main functionality is there. Will consider coming back to fix.

## I want to move on to more advanced projects. Probably going to drop bootstrap.

## Features i would like frontend to have:

- fetch data from backend ✔
- Add a todo ✔
- list of todos ✔
- dark/light mode toggle ✔
- manage a dark/light mode in localStorage ✔
- UI for creating , editing and deleting todos (CRUD) ✔

# Future ideas:

- Add login/logout functionality ( with oAuth for maximum security ) ✘
- Relate every todo to a user , user can have multiple todos ✘
- Scheduled todos ✘
- Set todos that re come up every day/week/month/year? ✘
