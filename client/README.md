# Todo application client

UI made with the help of the frontend mentor todo challenge <https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW>

## Features i would like frontend to have:

- Add new todos ✔
- Mark todos as complete ✔
- Delete todos from the list ✔
- dark/light mode toggle ✔
- Filter by all/active/complete todos ✔
- Clear all completed todos ✔
- Drag and drop to reorder items on the list ✔
- Hover state on checkbox should be the check-gradient, but is a pain to do in CSS... ✔

## Future ideas:

- Save new order if todos are re-arranged (frontend/backend)
- Add login/logout functionality ( with oAuth for maximum security )
- Relate every todo to a user , user can have multiple todos
- Scheduled todos
- Set todos that re come up every day/week/month/year?
